Class materials for CS-1180 in Spring 2025

## Install Instructions
You will need to install a minimum of two things for this class: Java itself and an IDE to work in. IDE stands for Integrated Developement Environment. It is the program that you will use to write your code.

### Java Install
1. Navigate to [oracle.com](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk23-windows) to download Java. Oracle is the company behind Java.
2. The link will automatically take you to the Windows download page. If you use Linux or macOS, click the corresponding tabs.
3. If you are using Windows, select either the .exe or .msi installer. All of the installers contain the same thing, it is just the method of install that differs.
4. Once the file has downloaded, navigate to the downloaded file and double-click it to run the installe.
5. Follow all prompts.
6. Java is installed!

### IDE Install
There are many different IDEs available and each programmer finds one they like best. There is no required IDE for this class, so feel free to use any IDE you are familiar with (provided it supports Java). Below are installation instructions for two different IDEs. NOTE: You only need to install **ONE** of these IDEs, not both.

I (your instructor) will be using IntelliJ in class as I prefer its features for Java over VSCode.

The TAs are generally most familiar with VSCode, so if you do run into IDE issues, there is more help available for VSCode.

Over the course of your education, it is a good idea to become familiar with both, as they each serve their own purpose in the workforce. VSCode is often favored for being light-weight and more customizable. However, IntelliJ (and other more fully-fledged IDEs) often work better for large-scale projects and offer a plethora of built-in functionality especially since IntelliJ is designed specifically for Java. Proficient programmers should be able to program in any standard IDE

|**IntelliJ**|**VSCode**|
|:---:|:---:|
| Java specific | Supports many languages |
| More resource intensive | More lightweight |
| Git integration | Git integration |
| Easier start-up | More customization |
